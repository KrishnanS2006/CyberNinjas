## How To Play

### Introduction

Our Project for this Hackathon is a fun website where people rank their favorite memes... but with a **_major_** twist!

### Get Started

As soon as you enter a username, you will be added to a game. There, other players will join you to compete. Once there are enough players, you will be presented with 2 memes taken from Reddit.

### Choosing a Meme

When you are presented with the two memes, you will have 15 seconds to choose one. The major twist with our website is that the objective is not to choose which meme you like better! Instead, you need to choose which meme you think is more **_popular_**. To choose a meme, all you have to do is click on the it.

### Scoring

If you choose the meme that is the most popular, you will receive one point. If you choose the less popular meme, you will get 0 points. After 3 rounds, each with 2 memes, the winner will be decided.

### Rewards

If you win a round, you will receive **_1 TRILLION POUNDS OF INVISIBLE GOLD!!!_**

## How It Was Made

### Aveek

Aveek created the backend of the project from scratch, including implementing the game logic, real-time communication, matchmaking, and more. Additionally, he helped a little with the UI.

### Krishnan

Krishnan coded most of the CSS and HTML for the project from scratch, to set up the styling and template. He also coded a some javascript to implement a timer that counts down to show you the time remaining.

### Aryan

Aryan also helped Krishnan with coding the frontend of the project, by optimizing it for mobile users by using JavaScript. In addition, he worked on coding the timers for the event sequences within the NodeJS server.

### Harsh

Finally, Harsh helped Aveek with a few changes in the javascript files to manage the website better.

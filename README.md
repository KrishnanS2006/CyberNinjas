## Introduction
Our Project for this Hackathon is a fun website where people rank their favorite memes... but with a ***major*** twist!  
## Get Started
As soon as you enter a username, you will be added to a game. There, other players will join you to compete. Once there are enough players, you will be presented with 2 memes taken from Reddit.
## Choosing a Meme
When you are presented with the two memes, you will have 15 seconds The major twist with our website is that the objective is not to choose which meme you like better! Instead, you need to choose which meme you think is more ***popular***.  
  
To choose a meme, all you have to do is click on the meme you like better. Once you click on the meme, you will see the percent of players who voted for that meme.  
## Scoring
If you choose the meme that is the most popular, you will receive one point. If you choose the less popular meme, you will get 0 points. After 5 rounds, each with 2 memes, the winner will be decided.
## Rewards
If you win a round, you will receive ***1 TRILLION POUNDS OF INVISIBLE GOLD!!!***
